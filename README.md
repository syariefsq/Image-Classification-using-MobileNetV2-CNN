# 🛣️ Clean/Dirty Road Image Classification — My Deep Learning Story

## 👋 Hi, I’m Syarief!

Thanks for stopping by! I created this project to combine my passion for AI with a real-world challenge: making cities cleaner and smarter. I wanted to see how far I could push deep learning to solve a problem that affects millions—road cleanliness.


## 🌟 Why I Built This

- Inspired by the messy streets in growing cities, I wanted to automate the tedious job of road inspection.
- My goal was to build something practical—helping city planners and cleaning teams make faster, data-driven decisions.
- I challenged myself to deliver not just a model, but a deployable, user-friendly solution with real impact.



## 💪 What I Learned & Challenges Overcome

- Tackled noisy, unbalanced image data and learned to improve model generalization with transfer learning.
- Integrated multiple CNN architectures (MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet50) and benchmarked their strengths.
- Built an interactive web app and infographic—turning raw predictions into actionable insights for users.
- Experimented with LLM-powered strategy generation, bridging AI with urban management.



## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- **Python** for everything from preprocessing to deployment.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and fine-tuning neural networks.
- **Scikit-learn** for evaluation and metrics.
- **Streamlit** for deploying a user-friendly web app.
- **Kaggle API** for seamless dataset access.
- **HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JS, Chart.js** for custom, interactive visuals.
- **Google Gemini API** for AI-driven recommendations.



## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Built and compared several CNN models for binary image classification.
- Deployed the best model as a live demo: [CVRoadCleanlinessClassifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/syariefsq/ComputerVisionRoadCleanlinessClassifier)
- Integrated an AI assistant to generate cleaning strategies for city teams.
- Designed an interactive infographic to make insights accessible to non-technical users.


## 🔭 What’s Next?

- Expand the dataset for better coverage and robustness.
- Explore advanced architectures and real-time video analysis.
- Integrate geospatial mapping for city dashboards.
- Push edge deployment for on-device predictions.
